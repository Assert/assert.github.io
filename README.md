#Assert Website

This website (as you can see) is hosted on GitHubPages. It is therefor a static page. To be able to get some “dynamic-functionality” we use Jekyll. Jekyll lets us convert pure `markdown` files to `html`.

**The procedure**
1. Write a new markdown file and put it in the `_posts` folder
2. Convert it to html `jekyll serve`
3. Add file to git `git add [filename]`
4. Commit the change `git commit -m ‘New post about……`
5. Push to GitHub `git push origin master`
